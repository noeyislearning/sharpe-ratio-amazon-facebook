# Sharpe Ratio Amazon and Facebook

This notebook explores the Sharpe Ratio and its application to evaluate the performance of two tech giants: Amazon and Facebook. The Sharpe Ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return, which tells us how much excess return we are receiving for the extra volatility that we endure for holding a riskier asset.

## Notebook Description

In financial markets, the trade-off between risk and return is crucial. The Sharpe Ratio, a renowned financial metric, assesses the risk-adjusted return of investments. It allows investors to compare investment opportunities while considering both returns and risk.

## Key Objectives

1. **Data Preparation**, begin by importing necessary modules and reading stock data for Amazon and Facebook, as well as benchmark data (S&P 500).

2. **A First Glance at the Data**, take a preliminary look at the data to understand the available observations and variables for analysis.

3. **Plot & Summarize Daily Prices**, visualize and summarize the daily stock prices for Amazon and Facebook before calculating the Sharpe Ratio.

4. **Visualize & Summarize Daily Values for S&P 500**, examine the daily values of the S&P 500 (the benchmark) to understand its performance.

5. **The Inputs for the Sharpe Ratio**, to calculate the Sharpe Ratio, daily stock returns are needed. Calculate and summarize the daily returns.

6. **Daily S&P 500 Returns**, calculate and summarize the daily returns of the S&P 500.

7. **Calculating Excess Returns**, determine the excess returns for Amazon and Facebook by subtracting the daily S&P 500 returns from the daily stock returns.

8. **The Sharpe Ratio**, calculate the Sharpe Ratio for Amazon and Facebook to assess their risk-adjusted returns and make a meaningful comparison.

9. **Putting it All Together**, Compute the Sharpe Ratio by dividing the average excess return by the standard deviation of excess returns.
